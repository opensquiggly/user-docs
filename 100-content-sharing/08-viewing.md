Once you've been granted permissions to read a mount point in an organization,
you can graft mount point documents into your document tree in the same way that
you graft in content from personal mount points.

This is done by creating a mapped page to the mount point in the organization.

To add a mapped page, first click the + icon in the header of the navigator

Fill in the "Add Mapped Page" section as follows:

* Enter the Title of the page as you wish it to appear in the navigator (Note: This does not
  need to be the same name as the page you will be referencing)
* Personal/Organization Field
  - Pick the organization that owns the mount point you wish to view
* Mount Point - Next select the mount point you wish the mapped page to reference
* Relative Path - Enter the path to the location of the document within to mount point. To
  reference the entire point point with a document tree, enter "/".
* Press Add New to add the new mapped page to the bottom (last child) of the current page.

For more details, see the "Mapping Pages to Mount Points" section i~~~~n the chapter "Managing
and Navigating Your Document Tree".
