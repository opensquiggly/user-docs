# Sharing Content with Others

Teams often want to set up a base of documents that can shared with the whole team.
This is done by creating organizations, adding mount points that are owned by that
organization, and then granting permissions to groups of people within the organization.

In this chapter we'll discuss:

* Creating an organization
* Adding OpenSquiggly users as a member of the organization
* Granting administrative privileges to one or more users
* Creating external connections owned by the organization
* Creating mount points owned by the organization
* Creating groups within the organization and managed group membership
* Granting access to mount points to one or more groups
* Viewing content from organizations you belong to
* Searching for content in organizations you belong to
