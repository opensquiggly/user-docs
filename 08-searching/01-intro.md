Title: Introduction to Searching
---
# Overview

A key component to OpenSquiggly is it's integrated search engine that lets you search both
your documents and source code with a single, integrated, unified search syntax.

OpenSquiggly indexes your documents to enable high-performance search and to give you a rich
syntax for filtering the result list. If you're curious, we use ElasticSearch as our search
indexing engine, but we use it in a special way. We add extra logic to the way ElasticSearch
indexes and searches documents, thus enabling regular expression searching of your files.

Being able to perform regular expression searches across all your files in all of your projects
is a great convenience and another part of our value proposition.
