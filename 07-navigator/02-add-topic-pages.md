# Adding New Pages to the Bottom

Whichever current document you are on, the navigator displays the list of child pages for
that page.

To quickly add a new page to the bottom (in other words, the last child), click the + icon in
the header row across from the document title at the top of the navigator.

A form section will expand to let you enter the information for the page you wish to add.

### Adding a New Topic Page

To add a new topic page, in the "Add Topic Page" section of the form, enter the name of the
page you wish to create, and press the "Add New" button.

A new, empty page will be created and added to the bottom (last child) of the current page.

### Adding a Mapped Page

A mapped page is a reference to document or document tree within a mount point.

To add a mapped page:

* Enter the Title of the page as you wish it to appear in the navigator (Note: This does not
  need to be the same name as the page you will be referencing)
* Personal/Organization Field
  - To add a page from your personal mount points, select Personal in the drop down list
  - To add a page from an organization you belong to, pick it in the drop down list
* Mount Point - Next select the mount point you wish the mapped page to reference
* Relative Path - Enter the path to the location of the document within to mount point. To
  reference the entire point point with a document tree, enter "/".
* Press Add New to add the new mapped page to the bottom (last child) of the current page.

# Adding a Child Page to a Specific Page

To add a new child page to either the top or bottom of a specific page within the navigator,
locate the page to which you want to add the new child page, and press the "..." elipsis
icon on the corresponding row on the right hand side.

Select "Add child to top" or "Add child to bottom".

A new text edit box will appear at the location of either the first child or last child in
the desired page's subtree, depending on which menu item you selected.

Enter the name of the page you wish to create and click the Add button, or click the Cancel
button to cancel the operation and return to normal tree operation.

# Adding a Sibling Page to a Specific Page

A sibling page is a page that shares the same parent.

For any page in the document tree (regardless of the depth level), you can insert a new
sibling page either above or below that page.

Locate the desired page where you wish to insert the new sibling page, and press the "..."
elipsis icon on the corresponding row on the right hand side.

Select "Add sibling above" or "Add sibling below".

A new text edit box will appear at the location you specified, either above or below the
target page.

Enter the name of the page you wish to create and click the Add button, or click the Cancel
button to cancel the operation and return to normal tree operation.
