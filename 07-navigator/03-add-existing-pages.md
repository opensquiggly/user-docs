# Why Add an Existing Page

The following chapters discuss various ways in which you can rearrange your document tree,
copy page references to other parts of the document tree, or add an existing page which
is not already in your document tree.

You might wonder why these operations are available and what purpose they serve.

### Mapping Pages

First, you might want to graft in documents from a mount point into one or more places in
your document tree. Note that create a mount point, as discuseed in the chapters "Mounting
Source Code Repositories" and "Mounting Documentation Repositories" merely makes those documents
available to be placed into your document tree. Mounting a repository does not automatically
add it to your document tree (unless you use the Quick Add form, in which case it can map
it for you automatically).

In this case, once you've created a mount point, you'll want to add it to your document tree.
This is discussed in the next section, "Mapping Pages to Mount Points".

### Moving and Copying Pages

Once you've placed a document in your tree, you may change your mind and wish to move it
to another place in the tree.

You may also wish to copy a reference to the same page to one or more locations in your document
tree. For example, suppose a particular document is relevant to two different bugs you are
working on. You might want to put a copy of the document alongside the notes you're writing for
each bug fix.

These operations are covered in the section "Moving and Copying Pages".

### Removing and Recovering Pages

Removing a page from your document tree does not permanently delete it. It can be recovered
and placed back into your tree when desired.

These operations are discussed in the section "Removing and Recovering Pages".
