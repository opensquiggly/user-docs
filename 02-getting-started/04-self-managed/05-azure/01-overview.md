# Azure Installation Options
To install OpenSquiggly in your Microsoft Azure cloud account, choose from the following
options:

* Virtual Machine Quick Setup - This method uses a setup script supplied by use to quickly
  format and prepare your data disk, install application dependencies, and install the
  OpenSquiggly Web Service.
* Virtual Machine Detailed Setup - This method is similar to using the setup script, but
  instead gives you detailed instructions on how to install the application dependencies.
  Use this method of you need more control over network security than the canned setup
  script provides.
* Azure App Service - Install OpenSquiggly from a Docker image onto an Azure App Service.
* Azure Kubernetes Service - If you need high scalability and availability, choose this option,
  which has become the accepted "gold standard" of cloud deployment technology.
