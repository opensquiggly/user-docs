  A brief discussion of the three page modes: view, edit, and edit page options.

## Page Modes

When you navigate and read documents in OpenSquiggly, the page is by default in "View" mode.

View mode shows the final preentation format of the document, and the document is fully interactive.
Hyperlinks work as the author intended them, images are visible, etc.

There are two additional page modes that we will discuss in this chapter:

* Edit Mode - Allows you to add, edit, and modify page content of internally authored documents
* Edit Page Options - Allows you to view and change certain page behaviors and metadata about the page

Note that these two page modes are only available for internally authored documents. If the page
you are viewing is hosted in a location that you've previously "mounted" (See Chapter 3 & 4), then
you won't see the options available.
