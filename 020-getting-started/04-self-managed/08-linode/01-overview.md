options:

* Virtual Machine Quick Setup - This method uses a setup script supplied by use to quickly
  format and prepare your data disk, install application dependencies, and install the
  OpenSquiggly Web Service.

  instead gives you detailed instructions on how to install the application dependencies.

  script provides.
* Linode Kubernetes Engine - If you need high scalability and availability, choose this option,
  which has become the accepted "gold standard" of cloud deployment technology.
